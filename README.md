How the script works
===========

The script is already fully commented and you should not face any issues in understanding how it works.

* To run it though, here are what you need to do :
* Download https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Set the working directory to point at "UCI HAR Dataset", which is the default name of the extracted folder inside the previously downloaded zip file. 
* Download and place the script inside the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

Now you can run the script.
Again, the code has been commented a lot, so you can go straight and check it.
